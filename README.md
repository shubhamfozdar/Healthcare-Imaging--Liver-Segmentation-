![liver_segmentation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0446c4d-2465-493e-ae66-74ef3c8f426e)

Results: As the Above image shows that this liver has a tumor which is labeled on the right side in yellow marks, thus this work is done using this model using Monai and Pytorch

Technologies used: Monai , Pytorch , CUDA , CUNN
